README for MrFineDance Project
Overview
The MrFineDance project consists of a client-server architecture where the frontend is built using Node.js (possibly with a framework like React) and the backend is powered by a Python Flask server. This README provides basic instructions on how to set up and run both parts of the project.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Python (3.7)
Node.js
npm (usually comes with Node.js)
Setting up the Server (Flask)
Navigate to the Server Directory:


cd path/to/flask-server
Set up a Virtual Environment (Optional but recommended):


python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install Dependencies:


pip install Flask
Additional Configurations:
Check config.py for any specific configurations that might be needed.

Run the Server:
python server.py


Setting up the Client
Navigate to the Client Directory:
cd path/to/client
Install Dependencies:


npm install
Start the Client:
npm start
Usage
Once both the server and client are running, you can interact with the application through the web interface provided by the client. The Flask server will handle backend requests and operations.

Note
The provided steps are basic and might require adjustments based on your specific project setup.
For detailed information about the client, refer to the README.md in the client directory.
Feel free to use and modify this README as needed for your project
